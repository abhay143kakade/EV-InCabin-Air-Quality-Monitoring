# EV Smart Cabin Air Quality Monitoring System 🚗🌿

## AI-Enabled Sustainable Air Quality Management for Electric Vehicles

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an AI-enabled Smart Cabin Air Quality Monitoring and Intelligent Ventilation System designed specifically for Electric Vehicles (EVs).

The system continuously monitors:

- Gas concentration (MQ2)
- Air pollutants (MQ135)
- Dust particles
- Temperature & Humidity (DHT11)

Using ESP32-based edge processing, the system automatically activates a ventilation fan when pollution levels exceed safety thresholds. The architecture supports CAN integration for vehicle networks and is cloud-ready for AI-based predictive analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Electric vehicle passengers are exposed to harmful pollutants, smoke, and dust—especially in urban Indian traffic conditions. Existing EVs rely on manual HVAC control, which:

- Does not monitor real-time air quality
- Wastes battery energy
- Fails to ensure intelligent ventilation control

There is a need for a low-cost, scalable, and AI-ready cabin air management system tailored for the Indian EV ecosystem.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We designed a real-time, automated air quality monitoring system that:

- Continuously senses environmental parameters
- Uses edge computing for decision-making
- Automatically activates ventilation when required
- Supports CAN communication for EV integration
- Enables future AI-based predictive analytics via cloud platforms
