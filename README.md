EV In-Cabin Air Quality Monitoring System (IoT Based)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an IoT-based In-Cabin Air Quality Monitoring System for Electric Vehicles (EVs).

The system continuously monitors the air quality inside the vehicle cabin to ensure passenger safety and comfort. It detects harmful gases and environmental parameters and transmits real-time data for monitoring and analysis.

This solution is especially useful in urban areas where pollution levels can directly affect in-cabin air quality.
